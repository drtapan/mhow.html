<h> History </h>
<p>This cantonment town was founded in 1818 by John Malcolm as a result of the Treaty of Mandsaur between the English and the Holkars who were the Maratha Maharajas of Indore.

It was after this battle that the capital of the Holkars shifted from the town of Maheshwar on the banks of the Narmada to Indore.<br>Mhow used to be the headquarters of the 5th (Mhow) Division of the Southern Command during the British Raj. Today this small town is associated with the Indian Army and with Bharat Ratna Dr. B. R.
